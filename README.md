# Fixly – Software Design Diagrams

This repository contains the software design diagrams developed for the project **Fixly – A Customer Service Website**. It includes **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** showing how data moves through the system, **System Sequence Diagrams (SSDs)** illustrating user interactions and message flows during key use cases, and a **Class Diagram** representing the structural design of entities. Together, these diagrams provide a clear understanding of the system’s functionality and behavior.
