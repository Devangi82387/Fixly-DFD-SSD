# Fixly-DFD-SSD

This repository includes essential software design diagrams—Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and System Sequence Diagrams (SSDs)—developed for Project "Fixly". The DFDs represent how data moves through the system, showing processes, data stores, and external entities at various levels of detail. The SSDs illustrate the dynamic interaction between users and the system by capturing the sequence of messages exchanged during key use cases. Together, these diagrams provide a clear understanding
of system behavior.
